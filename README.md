# DHCP
A simple DHCP server

This DHCP server was created during a academic project and was test on a virtual machine, of course you will need to setup your virtual machine in order to make it work.
It is written in french but despite that its rather intuitive.
This server takes into account 4 types of messages : Discover, Offer, Acknowledgment and Request.

I hope it will help.
